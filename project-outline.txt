Project Outline!

User can use a comand to create new tags and they are stored in a list of tags
All tags are in a master list of json and in each tag is the usernames

to add a user simply set the tag with /tag and if the tag does not exist a error is printed saying something like "this tag doesnt exist try creating it with /create or check /list to see if you misspelled an existing list or try /help for a list of commands"

/tags will list all tags

/add {name} will add whatever username to the current tag
/remove {name} will remove a username from the current tag

/ss {&!} will generate a search string of the current tag

/list will print out a list of the users in the current tag

/delete {name} will delete a tag
/create {name} will create a new tag

/help will outline how to use everything and refrence /commands
/commands will list commands
